This is how I set up my Raspberry Pi when it has crashed for any reason.

- Reboot the Pi and from the Berryboot menu select to Restore from Image.
  This will ERASE EVERYTHING on the pi, but that's the plan.
- Let tht Pi reboot again and display the Raspberry Pi Config Tool on startup.
  Change user password, I always do this unless you want to stick with 'raspberry'.
  If you want to: change the name of your Pi to something else (advanced options: hostname).
  Enable SSH to be able to login remotely (advanced options).
  I also update the tool to latest version (advanced options).
  Note: You can re-run this utility at any time with 'sudo raspi-config'.
- Exit the config tool, and:
  Reboot the pi: 'sudo shutdown -r now'
- Let the Pi reboot and from another computer:
  ssh mypi@mypiname
  Note: Obviously, you would need to provide your Pi's host name and password.
- Now, logged in I begin by downloading of the following script from my GitHub repo:
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SourceCodeSourcerer/NetHomeServer/master/server-install/src/main/scripts/remote-install/raspberrypi/clean_setup.sh
- Make it executable, and then - Important! - launch it as root:
  chmod +x clean_setup.sh
  sudo ./clean_setup.sh
- Answer all the questions with 'Y' and have the script download and setup the components, which are: Java JDK 7, noip support, Tellstick, and NetHomeServer.
- After the script has finished, you may want to check whether your Tellstick - you do have one, don't you? - is configured in Linux:
  http://wiki.nethome.nu/doku.php/installtellstickdriverlinux?s[]=tellstick
- Now everything should be set up, except 'your' default.xml file. So what I do then is to copy over the backup - Yes! I do have a backup - to the pi:
  scp default.xml mypi@mypiname:nethomeservernightly/lib
- Lastly: reboot and enjoy!
  sudo shutdown -r now
